    "Machine learning is a way of programming that builds prediction models. Unlike traditional programming, which spells out exact steps, machine learning uses algorithms to learn the link between input features and the output label by studying lots of data.\n",

    "Simply put, a machine learning model is like a function that takes input features `(x)` and returns a prediction `(y)`, written as `y = f(x)`.\n",

    "- **Incomplete data**: Some fields are missing (NULL). You can fill in missing values (e.g., using the mean) or drop incomplete rows.\n",
    "- **Errors**: Data entry mistakes happen and need careful checking with queries and visualizations to spot unusual values.\n",
    "- **Outliers**: Extreme values can skew the model. You might remove them or replace them with a capped value.\n",
    "- **Incorrect data types**: Numeric data may be wrongly stored as text. You must fix types to match the data.\n",

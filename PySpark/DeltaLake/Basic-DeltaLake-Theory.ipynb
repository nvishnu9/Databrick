    "**Data Lakehouse Storage Layer Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The storage layer manages and organizes data stored within the data lake.\n",

    "* Delta Lake is *not* a storage medium or format; rather, it works atop formats like Parquet or JSON to enhance functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges in Traditional Data Lakes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Traditional data lakes often suffer from data inconsistency and performance limitations.\n",
    "* A major cause is the lack of ACID transaction support, making it hard to guarantee data integrity.\n",
    "* Without ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), issues such as partial writes and failed transactions can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delta Lake Capabilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Delivers ACID transaction guarantees for data manipulation operations.\n",
    "* Ensures operations are atomic and consistent—either all succeed or none are committed.\n",
    "* Helps build reliable, consistent, and durable data lakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Integration and Open Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimized for cloud object storage solutions, including Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, and Google Cloud Storage.\n",
